### B-003 — Playwright harness and a screenshot helper
- **Scope:** `pyproject.toml` (dev extra), `tests/e2e/__init__.py`,
  `tests/e2e/conftest.py`, `tests/e2e/test_smoke.py`, `scripts/screenshot.py`
- **Accept:** Playwright installs via pip (no npm); a fixture boots the app on an ephemeral
  port and tears it down; one e2e test asserts `/` renders with zero console errors;
  `scripts/screenshot.py <route>` writes PNGs at 1440/1024/768 and prints the paths.
  This is the tool the reviewer and design role depend on, so it must work unattended.
- **Added 2026-08-16, from the B-002 review:** the e2e smoke test must also assert **zero
  requests to non-local hosts**. The unit-level sweep in `tests/test_app.py` cannot see
  inside CSS, so `@import url(https://fonts.googleapis.com/…)` — the likeliest future §3
  breach, arriving with D-002's stylesheets — would pass it. A browser-level assertion
  catches whatever the page actually fetches, which is the guarantee shared §3 needs.
- **Depends on:** B-002 (**done**, merged `ff801fa`)
- **Branch / PR:** `task/b-003-playwright-harness` — #4
- **Status:** in review (cycle 2)
- **Cycle 2 resolution:** suggested-major fixed, not overruled. `_goto_or_raise()` navigates
  and converts a Playwright `TimeoutError` — **specifically that, not any `PlaywrightError`**
  — into a `RouteNotServedError` naming the stuck URL; `capture()` now calls it in place of a
  bare `page.goto`. Three new tests drive a real stdlib `http.server` whose `/hang` route
  never responds, reproducing the reviewer's own repro rather than mocking it. The coder
  then mutation-tested its own fix: reverting to a bare `page.goto` made 2 of the 3 fail with
  exactly the raw `playwright._impl._errors.TimeoutError` the review reported, restored
  before committing. 49 tests pass (46 + 3), flake8 clean, three PNGs still written.
- **Review, cycle 1:** 0 required, 1 suggested-major, 3 suggested-minor.
  - *Suggested-major* — `scripts/screenshot.py:236` (`main`) catches only `ScreenshotError`,
    so any Playwright failure other than a missing browser exits with a raw traceback and no
    PNG. Reproduced by the reviewer against a page holding a long-running `fetch()` open:
    `wait_until="networkidle"` never fires and the run dies after 30 s with a bare
    `playwright._impl._errors.TimeoutError`. **The design role will hit this on the first
    "run in progress" page**, which is exactly what M3 builds. The reviewer also tested SSE
    specifically and found it fine — a page with an open `EventSource` screenshots in 1.6 s
    — so `networkidle` is not the wrong default, it is merely unguarded. Fix is inside scope.
  - *Suggested-minor* ×3 → backlogged.
  - **The review earned its findings by mutation, not by reading.** It rebuilt the exact
    threat the off-origin assertion exists to stop — a scratch `static/css/main.css`
    containing `@import url("https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Inter")`, linked from
    `base.html` — and watched `test_index_page_requests_nothing_off_origin` fail with the
    Google URL in the diff. That is the D-002 guarantee demonstrated rather than asserted.
    It also broke the console/page-error guards, pointed `PLAYWRIGHT_BROWSERS_PATH` at an
    empty directory to confirm the suite *errors* rather than silently skipping, and opened
    `index-1440.png` to check it showed the real landing page and not an error page.
- **Recovered from an interrupted dispatch.** The 2026-08-16 dispatch was cut off before
  the coder reported. Discovered by the next session reading git rather than the list: two
  commits (`8e4c039`, `1a6ff77`) were already written and pushed, adding all four in-scope
  files (662 lines, 20 tests), but no `gh pr create` ran and no report came back, so the
  review could not start. The main working directory was also left checked out on this
  branch; returned to `main`. `pyproject.toml` was correctly untouched — `playwright` was
  already in the `dev` extra from B-001, so that part of the scope was satisfied before the
  task began.
- **Second dispatch added no code.** It was told explicitly not to trust the inherited work,
  and it did not: it stood up a fresh `.venv` and installed Chromium in its worktree
  (worktrees share no untracked files with the main checkout), then ran every criterion
  rather than reading the code and agreeing with it. It found nothing to fix — no vacuous
  assertions, no missed teardown path — so it opened PR #4 on the two inherited commits
  unchanged. A no-change PR is the honest outcome here; the work had simply never been
  verified by anyone, and now it has been once, by someone other than its author.
- **Verification reported:** 46 tests pass repo-wide (20 in `tests/e2e/`), `flake8 src/
  tests/ scripts/` clean, `scripts/screenshot.py /` writes three valid PNGs at exactly
  1440×900, 1024×900, 768×900. Non-vacuity is carried by dedicated guard tests: one forces a
  real `console.error`, another makes the page actually fetch
  `https://blocked.invalid/probe.png` and asserts the checker reports exactly that URL —
  which is what makes the off-origin assertion worth anything to D-002.
- **Environment note for the reviewer and design role:** this container's default Playwright
  browser cache (`/cache`) is not writable, so `PLAYWRIGHT_BROWSERS_PATH` must be exported
  before `playwright install chromium`. `screenshot.py`'s own `CHROMIUM_MISSING_HINT`
  already documents this; no code change was needed.

## Done — most recent first

### B-002 — FastAPI app factory and a served index route
- **Scope:** `src/fce_web/app.py`, `src/fce_web/routes/__init__.py`,
  `src/fce_web/routes/pages.py`, `tests/test_app.py`
- **Accept:** `create_app()` returns a FastAPI instance; `GET /` returns 200 with
  `text/html`, rendering `templates/index.html` with `title`; `StaticFiles` mounted at
  `/static` from `src/fce_web/static/` with `name="static"`, so `GET /static/js/app.js`
  returns 200; `Jinja2Templates` configured against `src/fce_web/templates/`; tested via
  `TestClient`, no live server needed
- **Depends on:** B-001 (done) and F-001 (**done**, merged `176f7d5`) — `templates/` and
  `static/` are front-end owned (shared §4) and now exist on `main`
- **Contract from F-001, not negotiable:** render `index.html` with exactly
  `{"title": <str>}` — the templates use `StrictUndefined`-clean single-variable context and
  reference static assets as the literal path `/static/js/app.js`, so the mount must be at
  `/static` from `src/fce_web/static/` or the page 404s its own script.
- **Branch / PR:** `task/b-002-app-factory` — #3
- **Status:** **done** (2 cycles) — merged as `ff801fa`. Verified on `main` after merging:
  26 tests pass, `/` → 200 HTML, `/static/js/app.js` → 200 JS, `/docs` and `/redoc` → 404.
- **Review, cycle 2:** 0 required, 0 suggested-major, 1 suggested-minor → backlogged (the
  external-host sweep does not cover static CSS; partly mitigated by the assertion added to
  B-003). The reviewer re-verified the fix against a live socket, probed the static mount
  for traversal and directory listing (all 404), mutation-tested both guards, and checked
  the cycle-1 overrule by opening `backlog.md` rather than taking it on trust — concluding
  that fixing it in scope would itself have been a `Required` scope finding.
- **Cycle 2 resolution:** required finding fixed — `docs_url=None, redoc_url=None`, which
  also removed a fourth remote-asset route the review had not spotted,
  `/docs/oauth2-redirect` (registered only when `docs_url` is set). `/openapi.json` kept
  deliberately: its body contains no absolute URL, so it breaches nothing in §3 — the
  offence was the two HTML pages that *render* the schema — and it is the machine-readable
  check that `docs/api.md` matches the routes that actually exist. Making the API surface
  non-enumerable is an API-policy call, not a §3 fix, so it was not made unilaterally →
  backlogged. Suggested-major overruled in writing → recorded in `backlog.md`.
  Suggested-minor left untouched as instructed, to keep the diff about the one required
  change.
- **Review, cycle 1:** 1 required, 1 suggested-major, 1 suggested-minor.
  - *Required* — `create_app()` left FastAPI's default `/docs` and `/redoc` enabled, and
    those pages pull Swagger UI and ReDoc from `cdn.jsdelivr.net` plus a Google-hosted font.
    That is a CDN link, a remote script and a runtime external font — three of the hard
    prohibitions in shared §3 — on an app whose whole point is to run in a classroom with no
    internet. Verified live by the reviewer, not inferred. Fix is inside scope:
    `docs_url=None, redoc_url=None`.
  - *Suggested-major* — the built wheel ships no `templates/` or `static/`, so under a
    non-editable install `create_app()` raises at the mount. Real, and already recorded in
    the backlog from the F-001 review; the fix needs `package-data`, which this task's
    `pyproject.toml` scope ("only add httpx") excludes. Expected resolution: coder overrules
    it as belonging to a follow-up packaging task.
  - *Suggested-minor* → backlogged (the module-state guard enumerates types, so it is
    allow-by-default).
- **Dependency sign-off:** `httpx` added to the `dev` extra **only**, approved by the user
  2026-08-15 (`TestClient` requires it). Test tooling; it must never become a runtime
  dependency. This is the first exercise of the new-dependency gate — record future ones
  the same way.

### B-001 — Python package skeleton, packaging, and a green test suite
- **Scope:** `pyproject.toml`, `.flake8`, `.gitignore`, `src/fce_web/__init__.py`,
  `tests/__init__.py`, `tests/test_skeleton.py`
- **Accept:** all five criteria met and independently re-verified by review
- **Depends on:** nothing
- **Branch / PR:** none — **B-001 predates the branch-per-task policy** (added
  2026-08-15, `.claude/orchestrator/CLAUDE.md` §4). Its files were written directly in the
  working tree. B-002 is the first back-end task to go through branch → PR → review →
  merge.
- **Status:** **done** (1 cycle, no rework)
- **Review:** 0 required, 0 suggested-major, 2 suggested-minor → backlogged
- **Notes:** venv at `.venv/bin/python` (Ubuntu system Python is PEP 668
  externally-managed) — later back-end tasks must use it, not `python3`. Python 3.12.3.
  `tests/` is a package, so `tests/e2e/` needs its own `__init__.py`. Reviewer
  mutation-tested all 8 tests: none are no-ops.
