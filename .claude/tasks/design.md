## In progress

### D-001 — Wireframe exploration: mission screen and recipe builder
- **Scope:** `docs/wireframes/` (output only — no application files)
- **Accept:** `/wireframe` run for both the mission screen and the recipe-card builder;
  options explore genuinely different information architectures, not restyles of one
  layout; each is annotated with what it optimises for; a recommendation is stated with
  reasoning. **Output goes to the user for a decision — this is an M1 checkpoint.**
- **Depends on:** nothing
- **Branch / PR:** `task/d-001-wireframes-clean` — #2
- **Status:** in review — **cycle 1 aborted**, re-dispatched 2026-08-16. The first reviewer
  hit the account session limit and terminated before producing any findings; its partial
  output is not a review and is deliberately not being forwarded to the replacement, which
  starts clean from the PR alone (orchestrator manual §4 rule 3). The orphaned agent
  worktree was removed; its branch, like every branch, was kept.
- **Branch note:** the planned branch `task/d-001-wireframes` was contaminated by F-001's
  commit `9f45703` during the shared-worktree collision (see the orchestrator manual §3).
  Design cherry-picked its own commit onto a fresh branch from `origin/main` rather than
  rebase, force-push or delete — the correct call. `task/d-001-wireframes` still exists at
  `4ce6561`, local only, never pushed. It is not deleted and not reused.
- **Coder's recommendation, for the checkpoint:**
  - *Mission screen* — **Option 2, Notebook Spread.** Method on the left, a run log on the
    right that grows downward instead of overwriting. The only option where a new run does
    not destroy the previous one, so "change one thing and compare" is carried by the
    layout rather than by a 15-year-old's memory; also the only one where missing the
    objective structurally reads as ordinary work rather than an error state. Costs the
    most to build and collapses into Option 5 at 768 px, so choosing it means building
    both. Cheaper fallback: Option 5. Avoid Option 1 despite its familiarity.
  - *Recipe builder* — **Option 1, Card Stack**, with one borrowing from Option 2: a
    collapsed card renders as a clause of a sentence ("Take data at 91 GeV from the IDEA
    detector.") rather than a settings summary. Free to do, and it is the difference
    between a stack that reads as a sentence — which the brief requires — and one that
    lists what you picked. Option 4, Guided Slots, is the fallback if playtesting shows
    students floundering in mission 1; the underlying config is identical, so switching
    later is front-end work, not a rebuild.

### D-002 — Design token foundation
- **Scope:** `src/fce_web/static/css/tokens.css`, `src/fce_web/static/fonts/`
- **Accept:** every colour, spacing, type-scale, radius, and timing value defined as a
  custom property; the lab-notebook palette committed with measured AA contrast ratios
  documented in the file; self-hosted woff2 fonts, no CDN; a chosen serif and mono that
  are explicitly not Inter/Roboto/system-ui/Space Grotesk
- **Depends on:** D-001 **and the user's layout decision** — the M1 checkpoint
- **Owed from D-001:** the wireframe contrast ratios were measured against wireframe white,
  because no paper colour exists yet. AA must be re-measured against the real paper token.
- **Branch / PR:** not yet opened
